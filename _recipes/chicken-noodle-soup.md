ingredients:
- Olive oil
- 4 Chicken breasts
- 3 or 4 large Carrots (diced)
- 2 or 3 stalks of Celery (diced)
- 1/2 Onion (diced)
- Chicken Broth/ bouillon
- Egg Noodles (Thick and short)
- Salt
- Pepper
instructions:
- Boil the chicken in a large pot and can skim off the top- low and slow is the game until the inner temp of chicken is 165f
- Scoop chicken out and shred with two forks as best as possible, then return to pot
- Add onion, carrots, and celery to the pot and bouillon to taste. Bring to boil, then simmer with lid on until the veggies are tender (check the carrots)
- Add noodles, then simmer/ boil for however long the packaging says for the noodles.
- Adjust pepper and salt levels as needed and serve. 
tips:
- The simpler the better
- May also cook onions, celery, and carrots with a little olive oil in a skillet before adding them to the pot, but that leaves some of the juices and flavor left out of the soup.
