- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar

instructions:
- Salt and Pepper both sides of the pork chop and allow to tenderize for about 30 minutes (don't really need to wait that long necessarily)
- Mix flour, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika in a small bowl
- Pat dry the pork chops and coat each side of the pork chops with the spice rub.
- Sear pork chops in an oiled skillet for 2-3 minutes each side. Reduce heat significantly and cover pan. Allow to finish cooking (until pork registers ~145 degrees)
- Remove and allow pork to rest
- Increase the heat of the pan. Add chicken stock, vinegar, and honey. Cook it down until volume is about half. Add butter and pork back to the pan. Allow to simmer until the sauce has completely thickened to the pork chops.
