ingredients:
- 1 recipe of pie crust
- butter
- sugar
- cinnamon
instructions:
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees
- Make one recipe of pie crust. Divide into three dough balls. Place 2 in the fridge until needed
- Roll out one ball of dough until it is about 1/16" thick
- Cut into six sections
- For each section put about 1/6 tbsp of butter, 1 1/2 tbsp of sugar, and a hefty dash of cinnamon (1-2 pounds on the bottom of the bottle)
- Fold each side of the dough over to seal. Place folded side down into a greased glass pie pan
- Bake at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes or until golden brown and firm to the touch.
- Repeat for remaining balls of dough
tips:
- Folding- fold the center point to the outer edge first. Then fold the other two corners to the center. Fold all three remaining corners to the center and pinch together to seal the tart
- Chill dough for 15-30 minutes before rolling out
