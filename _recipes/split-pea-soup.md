ingredients:
- 2lbs split green peas
- 4 quarts of cold water
- 1 meaty ham bone
- 3 cups sliced onion
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon marjoram
- 2 cups diced celery
- 2 cups diced carrots
instructions:
- Cover peas with 4 quarts of cold water and soak overnight
- The next day, cook peas and water, bringing to a boil and simmering for about an hour. 
- Trim any excess fat or hard crust from ham. Add ham bone and bring soup just to poining. Then reduce heat, cover, and simmer 1 1/2 - 2 hours
- Remove ham bone and any large pieces floating in soup. Set aside until cooled
- Add onions and seasonings. Cover and continue to simmer. Stir frequently to avoid any burning on the bottom of the pot.
- When the ham bone has cooled, remove meat, trim and dice. Add diced ham to soup, cover, and continue to simmer
- Once peas and onions have mostly dissolved, add celery and carrots and simmer uncovered until tender, about 30-45 minutes
- Serve. Add salt and pepper to taste
tips:
- Be sure to stir constantly towards the end as water evaporates, otherwise it will burn on the bottom. 
- After it is done, be sure to store and freeze it right after it cools, otherwise it will separate.
