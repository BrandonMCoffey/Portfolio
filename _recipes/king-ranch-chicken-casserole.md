ingredients:
- Chicken (3 or more breasts)
- Corn tortillas (12 ish tortillas)
- Bag of frozen veggies (1 ish lbs- carrots, peas, green beans, etc)
- Cream of Mushroom (1 can)
- Golden Mushroom (1 can)
- Cheese (enough for 3 layers- either cheddar or monterey jack or mix)
instructions:
- I don't have a recipe written down but this one (link below) is pretty close to what I do.  The primary difference is instead of bell peppers I use a bag of frozen veggies. 
- I boil chicken (slow and low so it's tender). Then I shred the chicken (after it cools a bit) and set aside (carrots, peas, etc.).
- I mix the frozen veggies in a large bowl with some of the hot/warm broth and add a can of Cream of Mushroom and a can of Golden Mushroom.
- Slice the corn tortillas into strips. 
- Then layer a greased casserole pan with veggie mixture, shredded chicken, tortilla strips and cheese. Repeat until the ingredients run out. 
- Bake in the oven (preheated to 375) for 40 minutes.  I also broil it for a minute or two until the top layer of cheese starts to bubble and slightly brown.
- CAREFUL with the broiler.  You CAN NOT leave it alone.  Constantly watch the broiler. It goes from starting to brown to full on burn in what seems like an instant.
