ingredients:
- 40 saltine crackers (1 sleeve)

- 1 cup light brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 12 oz bag of milk chocolate chips
- Nutes or sprinkles (for topping)
instructions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
- Line the cookie sheet with nonstick aluminum foil 9 or use regular foil and spray generously with nonstick cooking spray.
- Cover the cookie sheet with one layer of saltine crackers.
- In a medium saucepan over medium high heat, bring butter and brown sugar to a boil, stirring continuously for about two minutes (it should be bubbly).
- Remove from heat, stir in one teaspoon pure vanilla extract.
- Pour toffee mixture over crackers, then bake for 6 minutes.
- Remove from the oven, sprinkle tops of warm crackers with milk chocolate chips.
- Allow chocolate to soften for a minute or two, then spread chocolate evenly on top of crackers. Now is the time to add sprinkles or chopped nuts to the top.
- Allow to cool, then break up into bite size pieces.
tips:
- You can speed the cooling process by popping the tray into the freezer
- You can also use white chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate chips
