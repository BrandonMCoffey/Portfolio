ingredients:
- 3 tbsp. Cashew Butter
- 2 tbsp. soy sauce
- 2 tbsp. Maple or Agave Syrup
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 tsp. Chinese five spice
- 4 chicken breasts (diced)
- 1 head broccoli (cut into florets)
- 40g cashew nuts
- 2 red chillies (diced)
- Handful fresh coriander
- 300g basmati rice (cooked)
instructions:
- Preheat oven to 200 C or 180 C for fan-assisted. In a large bowl, whisk together cashew butter, soy sauce, maple syrup, garlic and five spice.
- Add the diced chicken and broccoli florets to the bowl and coat well.
- Pour the contents of the bowl into a deep baking tray and bake for 20 minutes.
- Meanwhile, toast your cashew nuts. Heat a frying pan on a high heat, add the cashews and don't move them until they begin to brown and pop a little. Toss and allow to brown on the other side.
- Once the cashew chicken and broccoli are baked, stir through the cashew nuts and chillies, divide and place into Tupperware boxes with the cooked basmati rice. Sprinkle a little chopped coriander over each and refrigerate. Easy!
