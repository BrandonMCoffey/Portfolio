ingredients:
- 1 tbsp curry paste
- 1 tbsp mango chutney
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 1 serving salt (to taste)
- 50 ml olive oil
- 4 chicken breasts
- 300 g couscous
- 350 ml vegetable stock
- Optional- Pomegranate seeds
- Optional- Coriander
instructions:
- To make a marinade for your chicken, add the curry paste, chutney, turmeric, salt and olive oil to a bowl and mix it well.
- Cut each chicken breast in half before adding to the marinade. Stir well until all of the chicken is covered.
- Leave the chicken aside for at least 20 minutes - ideally in the fridge overnight.
- Heat a grill pan over medium heat and lay out your chicken pieces. Grill the chicken pieces for 5-6 minutes on each side, or until golden and slightly charred.
- Meanwhile, place the couscous in a big bowl and carefully pour in the boiling vegetable stock. Cover the bowl with a lid and leave to the couscous to soak for around 5 minutes.
- Fluff your couscous with a fork and add any extras you want. Pomegranate seeds are great for a color and flavor.
- Divide your couscous into 4 containers before topping with two pieces of marinated chicken. Finish the dish with a sprinkle of coriander.
