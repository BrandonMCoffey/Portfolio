ingredients:
- 1 pie crust
- 8 cups of honeycrisp apples
- 2/3 cup of brown sugar
- 11/4 cup of flour
- 1/4 tsp of cinnamon
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1/2 cup of white sugar
- 1/2 cup butter
instructions:
- Make pie crust first to allow time to sit in fridge
- While the pie crust is cooling, peel and core your apples. Mix with cinnamon, lemon juice, white sugar, and 1/4 cup of flour. Stir and allow time for apples to soften from sugar.
- Make topping by mixing butter, brown sugar, and remaining flour. Cut until consistent with pastry knife or forks
- Roll out pie crust until slightly larger than the pie plate. Fold into fourths to reduce tearing, place into a pie pan and unfold.
- Spoon in the apple filling and cover with the streusel topping.
- Sprinkle sugar on top of pie to make crisp
- Place in oven at 400 degrees for 45-55 minutes
