ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 chicken thighs
- 4 chicken drumsticks
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 4 shallots, sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, peeled, crushed
- 4 sprigs thyme
- 3/4 cup dry white wine
- 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
instructions:
- Preheat the oven to 425 . 
- Heat oil in a Dutch oven or other heavy-lidded pot over medium-high heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side; transfer to a plate.
- Add shallots and garlic to pot and cook, stirring often, until beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. 
- Add thyme and white wine; bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until reduced by 2/3, about 4 minutes.
- Return chicken, skin side up, to pot; add broth, bring to a simmer, cover, and transfer to the oven. 
- Braise until chicken is cooked through and tender, 20-25 minutes. 
- Uncover; continue to cook in the oven until skin begins to crisp, 8-10 minutes longer.
tips:
- Add rice or more onions
