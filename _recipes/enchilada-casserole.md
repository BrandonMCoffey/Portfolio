ingredients:
- 1 lb ground turkey or beef
- 1 packet taco seasoning low sodium
- (prepare meat using instructions in the packet and set aside)
- 1 bag minute brown or white rice cooked (follow instructions in packet)
- 1 can pinto beans (drained and rinsed)
- 1 can enchilada sauce el Paso (biggest can)
- 1 can unsalted corn (drained)
- 1 big bag of Mexican shredded cheese (the more cups the cheesier)
- 2 medium bags Fritos (you can substitute with mission corn tortillas)
- 1 tub sour cream for toping
- 1 avocado for toping
instructions:
-  Preheat oven to 350 F 
-  In a Pyrex pan put a thin layer of enchilada sauce and proceed to place all the ingredients in layers evenly distributed. 
-  I will do the crushed chips or tortillas first, then the meat, corn, a layer of cheese (a rich layer is better), rice, beans and more tortillas or chips crushed. 
-  Top the whole thing with a lot of cheese and the sauce. The sauce is at the end and make sure it sips through the bottom by poking the whole thing with a fork several times and all over. 
-  Wiggle the fork to promote liquid movement to the bottom of the pan.  
-  Place in oven and cook for 35 minutes.
tips:
- To make it more healthy you can make your own taco seasoning (1 tbsp chili powder, 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt,  1 1/2 tsp cumin, 1 1/2 tsp cornstarch, 1 tsp pepper), use 1 cup of regular brown rice, organic meat and beans, and tortillas.  You can also make your own enchilada sauce just look for a healthy recipe on the internet.
