ingredients:
- 1 unbaked Flaky Pie Crust (what I used) or All Butter Pie Crust
- 4 large eggs
- 1/2 cup whole milk
- 1/2 cup heavy cream or heavy whipping cream
- 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper
- up to 1 cup shredded or crumbled cheese (see recipe note)
- up to 2 cups add-ins (see recipe note)
- optional toppings for serving extra cheese, chopped herbs, hollandaise sauce, & freshly ground pepper to taste
instructions:
- Pie crust- I like to make sure my pie dough is prepared before I begin the quiche. Make pie dough the night before because it needs to chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before rolling out and blind baking (next step).
- Preheat oven to 375 F (190 C). Partially blind bake your pie crust. Follow blind baking instructions through step 9 in your 9-inch pie dish. Step 4 is optional, though that step guarantees thick pie crust edges. Crust can still be warm when you pour in the filling. (You can partially pre-bake the crust up to 3 days ahead of time. Cover cooled crust tightly and refrigerate until ready to fill.)
- Reduce oven temperature to 350 F (177 C).
- In a large bowl with a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the eggs, whole milk, heavy cream, salt, and pepper together on high speed until completely combined, about 1 minute. Whisk in add-ins.
- Bake the quiche until the center is just about set, about 45-55 minutes. Don't over-bake. Use a pie crust shield to prevent the pie crust edges from over-browning. Allow to cool for 15 minutes. Top with optional toppings before slicing and serving, if desired. Or you can cool the quiche completely before serving- it's fantastic at room temperature!
- This quiche makes great leftovers! Cover tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
tips:
- Quiche Recipes- Leave out added salt, then whisk in these ingredients in step 4. Crab, Old Bay, & Gruyere- 1 and 1/2 cups fresh jumbo lump crabmeat (it's sold as "fresh" but it is always pre-cooked), 1 cup shredded gruyere cheese, 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning, and dash of hot sauce. Bacon, White Cheddar, & Scallion- 6-8 cooked and crumbled bacon slices, 1 cup white cheddar cheese, and 3 Tablespoons chopped scallion. Ham, Spinach, & Feta- 1 cup cooked and cubed ham, 3 cups chopped fresh spinach (saute for a few minutes with a drizzle of olive oil over medium heat), and 3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese.
- Whole Milk & Heavy Cream- Use this combination for best taste. If desired, use 1 cup of half-and-half instead.
- Cheese- Some favorites include feta cheese, goat cheese, white cheddar cheese, Swiss cheese, and gruyere.
- Add-Ins- Add up to 2 cups add-ins including vegetables and meat/seafood. Most quiche add-ins should be pre-cooked and can still be warm when mixing into the egg filling. Pat dry prior to mixing in. See blog post for more information.
- Added Salt- Reduce or leave out salt if your add-ins and cheese are particularly salty. For example, in the 3 recipes listed in the next note, I don't even add salt!
- Make Ahead & Freezing instructions- The pie dough can be prepared ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months. You can pre-bake the crust ahead of time too. See end of step 2. To freeze, cool baked quiche completely, then cover tightly with a couple sheets of aluminum foil and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator or on the counter, then bake at 350 F (177 C) for 20-25 minutes.
