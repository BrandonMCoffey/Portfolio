ingredients:
- 3 tbsp Vegetable oil
- 1/2  onion (diced or large slices)
- 2 cloves of garlic (minced)
- 1 bag (7oz) Fideo noodles  (looks like short spaghetti)
- 8 oz can tomato sauce
- 8 oz can crushed tomatoes (can also have green chiles)
- 12 oz chicken broth (or more, depending on preference)
- 1 lb ground beef
- 3 large carrots (cut into small-ish pieces)
- 2 bell pepper of choice (cut into pieces)
- Salt
- Pepper
- Lime 
instructions:
- Noodles
- Add 1 tbsp of oil to a medium pot with the onion medium heat until onions are soft (adding a small dash of water if the onions get dehydrated). 
- Add 1 clove minced garlic until fragrant, stirring occasionally.
- Add 2 more tbsp of oil and fideo and cook until noodles are coated in oil and have started to brown (MAKE SURE NOT TO BURN).
- Add tomato sauce and broth (use more broth as needed) and bring to a boil. Reduce to low and simmer for 8-10 minutes or until noodles are soft.
- Meat
- Add 1 tbsp oil to a medium saucepan with the onion medium heat as well as the defrosted ground beef. When the beef is starting to brown, add the rest of the minced garlic and carrots.
- When the meat is done browning, add crushed tomatoes into the saucepan as well as salt and bell peppers. Cover with lid and let simmer on low until carrots and bell peppers are softened to liking (about 10 min)
tips:
- Can add whatever vegetables would like
- TOP WITH LIME AFTER PLATING
- If cut onion in large slices, it is easier to pick out later if you don't want it in the final plating with the noodles (meat you want the onion diced)
- Idk, my family eyeballs it so tweak this recipe as necessary
