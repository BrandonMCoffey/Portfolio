ingredients:
- 3/4 Cup short white rice
- 2 1/2 Cups of water
- 1 small piece of a cinnamon stick see picture below
- 3/4 cup whole milk
- 1/2 cup of condensed milk
- 1/4 cup of raisins optional
- Ground cinnamon for dusting
instructions:
- Place water, rice and the piece of cinnamon in a medium saucepan. Turn heat to high and bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for about 20 minutes, until rice is tender.
- While the rice is cooking, mix the whole milk with the condensed milk and stir well.
- The rice will be ready when all the water has evaporated and it has formed some holes over the surface like in the above picture.
- Remove pot from heat. Pour the whole milk and condensed milk mix into the saucepan and stir. If you would like to add the raisins or vanilla extract, you can add them now.
- Return the saucepan to heat, cover and keep cooking until it thickens. It will take about 5 to 10 minutes. Stir occasionally to avoid it from sticking to the bottom of the saucepan.
- If the rice looks too dry for your taste, add 1/4 cup of warm whole milk and stir. The end result has to look like a soft and creamy pudding.
- If serving warm, place in small cups and sprinkle ground cinnamon. When serving cold, pour rice pudding into a container and cover with a plastic wrap pressed down to the rice surface and refrigerate. Dust with cinnamon when serving.
tips:
- Short rice has a higher starch content, which will render a creamier rice pudding, but you can use medium or long grain rice as well.
- Skim milk or 2 % can also be used here; if you want a creamier consistency then a little more milk will be needed in the final cooking stage.
