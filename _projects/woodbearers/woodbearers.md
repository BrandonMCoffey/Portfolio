The Woodbearers is an Virtual Reality Experience hosted by the [New Mexico Museum of Art - Vladem Contemporary](https://www.nmartmuseum.org/vladem-contemporary/){: target="_blank"} that is based on [Clark Huling's Woodbearers of Chimayo Painting in 1974](https://www.clarkhulings.com/paintings/){: target="_blank"}. I was the lead developer on the project at the [VAST Lab]({{site.url}}/vast-lab/){: target="_blank"}.
