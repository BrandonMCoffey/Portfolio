For a research project I worked with a CS Graduate student to bring air tunnel wind data to a real-time visualization in VR with mid-air haptic feedback.

For a Metaverse-style project I modeled the CS lab I worked at and integrated Meta Avatars so we could experience the lab as a digital twin. Then, I designed various calibration methods to sync the Oculus Quest 2s with the real room so we could demo virtual avatars mixed with real people at the same location with the modality of a digital twin and IoT devices that sync between the real and virtual world.

For fun with a class project, I modeled the lab where the class was held, and demoed a simple multiplayer VR experience in the virtual version of the classroom.
