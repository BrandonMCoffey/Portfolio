The original Multi-cultural Mural was created in 1980 that honored the contributions made by different cultures to the history of New Mexico. The mural no longer exists, but at the same location there is a QR code that allows viewers to visualize the Multi-cultural through an augmented reality application on a smart device.

I was the primary developer on the project at the [VAST Lab]({{site.url}}/vast-lab/) and helped to preserve the mural in a digital form. The augmented reality application was designed using [8th wall](https://www.8thwall.com/){: target="_blank"} for easy access on a website. Once camera permissions are enabled, it uses computer vision and location services to display the image only at the actual location.
