Terraforming Mars is a board game by Jacob Fryxelius, and I created a digital version of the game in Unity. I sought to make the game and primary mechanics in a mostly intuitive way. I adapted the cards to engrain them in the system itself rather than keeping them as cards and added an AI enemy to play against.

Exploring Unityâ€™s UI solution, I set up dynamic UI that would support just about any aspect ratio and keep the game playable. This was not necessary for the project, but I learned a lot about proper UI implementation and best practices. Also, to speed up development and allow for simpler visual information, I designed custom inspector property drawers in Unity. These tools later culminated in my [Coffey Utils Package]({{site.url}}/projects/coffey-utils/).
