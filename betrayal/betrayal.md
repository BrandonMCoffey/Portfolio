# House on the Hill Capstone Project

#### Brandon Coffey and Jackie Garza

<br>

House on the Hill is a digital first person adaptation of the board game: Betrayal at House on the Hill by Avalon Hill. The game can be downloaded from Itch.io in the link below, along with a dedicated server to host the multiplayer aspects of the game (It is also playable single-player but intended for multiplayer).
