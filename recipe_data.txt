servings: 1

ingredients:
- 1/4 cup butter
- 3 tablespoons dark brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1 large egg yolk
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup all purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1/3 cup milk chocolate chunks
instructions:
- Heat oven to 350 degrees F
- In a small saucepan, brown the butter by melting it over medium heat, swirling the pan periodically to make sure the butter is cooking evenly. The butter will start to foam, then turn from a pale yellow to a toasty brown with a nutty aroma. Let cool for 10 minutes (you can speed up the process by setting the pan on top of ice or cold water - do not let any water get into the pan).
- Once the butter is no longer hot enough to cook the egg yolk, add the brown sugar, granulated sugar, egg yolk, water, and vanilla to the pan and beat with a handheld mixer until creamy, about 2 minutes.
- Add the flour, baking soda, and salt and mix just until combined. Stir in the chocolate chunks, then spread into one 6 1/4 mini cast iron skillet or two 8-ounce ramekins.
- Bake for 17-19 minutes if using the cast iron skillet (approx. 14-16 minutes if using ramekins) until the edges are puffy and slightly crispy while the center is still gooey and slightly under baked.
- Remove from the oven and serve warm, with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce, or hot fudge!

college: true
preptime: 30
resttime: 0
cooktime: 30
servings: 1

ingredients:
- 3/4 Cup short white rice
- 2 1/2 Cups of water
- 1 small piece of a cinnamon stick see picture below
- 3/4 cup whole milk
- 1/2 cup of condensed milk
- 1/4 cup of raisins optional
- Ground cinnamon for dusting
instructions:
- Place water, rice and the piece of cinnamon in a medium saucepan. Turn heat to high and bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for about 20 minutes, until rice is tender.
- While the rice is cooking, mix the whole milk with the condensed milk and stir well.
- The rice will be ready when all the water has evaporated and it has formed some holes over the surface like in the above picture.
- Remove pot from heat. Pour the whole milk and condensed milk mix into the saucepan and stir. If you would like to add the raisins or vanilla extract, you can add them now.
- Return the saucepan to heat, cover and keep cooking until it thickens. It will take about 5 to 10 minutes. Stir occasionally to avoid it from sticking to the bottom of the saucepan.
- If the rice looks too dry for your taste, add 1/4 cup of warm whole milk and stir. The end result has to look like a soft and creamy pudding.
- If serving warm, place in small cups and sprinkle ground cinnamon. When serving cold, pour rice pudding into a container and cover with a plastic wrap pressed down to the rice surface and refrigerate. Dust with cinnamon when serving.
tips:
- Short rice has a higher starch content, which will render a creamier rice pudding, but you can use medium or long grain rice as well.
- Skim milk or 2 % can also be used here; if you want a creamier consistency then a little more milk will be needed in the final cooking stage.

ingredients:
- 3 tbsp Vegetable oil
- 1/2  onion (diced or large slices)
- 2 cloves of garlic (minced)
- 1 bag (7oz) Fideo noodles  (looks like short spaghetti)
- 8 oz can tomato sauce
- 8 oz can crushed tomatoes (can also have green chiles)

- 1 lb ground beef
- 3 large carrots (cut into small-ish pieces)
- 2 bell pepper of choice (cut into pieces)
- Salt
- Pepper
- Lime 
instructions:
- Noodles
- Add 1 tbsp of oil to a medium pot with the onion medium heat until onions are soft (adding a small dash of water if the onions get dehydrated). 
- Add 1 clove minced garlic until fragrant, stirring occasionally.
- Add 2 more tbsp of oil and fideo and cook until noodles are coated in oil and have started to brown (MAKE SURE NOT TO BURN).
- Add tomato sauce and broth (use more broth as needed) and bring to a boil. Reduce to low and simmer for 8-10 minutes or until noodles are soft.
- Meat
- Add 1 tbsp oil to a medium saucepan with the onion medium heat as well as the defrosted ground beef. When the beef is starting to brown, add the rest of the minced garlic and carrots.

ingredients:
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup brown sugar, packed
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1 egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks
- 4 oz dark chocolate chunk, or your preference
instructions:
- In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.
- Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.
- Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).
- Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.
- Preheat oven to 350 F (180 C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.
- Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.
- Cool completely before serving.
tips:
- Makes about 12 large cookies

college: true
preptime: 30

cooktime: 30
servings: 1

ingredients:
- 1 unbaked Flaky Pie Crust (what I used) or All Butter Pie Crust
- 4 large eggs
- 1/2 cup whole milk
- 1/2 cup heavy cream or heavy whipping cream
- 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper
- up to 1 cup shredded or crumbled cheese (see recipe note)
- up to 2 cups add-ins (see recipe note)
- optional toppings for serving extra cheese, chopped herbs, hollandaise sauce, & freshly ground pepper to taste
instructions:
- Pie crust- I like to make sure my pie dough is prepared before I begin the quiche. Make pie dough the night before because it needs to chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before rolling out and blind baking (next step).
- Preheat oven to 375 F (190 C). Partially blind bake your pie crust. Follow blind baking instructions through step 9 in your 9-inch pie dish. Step 4 is optional, though that step guarantees thick pie crust edges. Crust can still be warm when you pour in the filling. (You can partially pre-bake the crust up to 3 days ahead of time. Cover cooled crust tightly and refrigerate until ready to fill.)
- Reduce oven temperature to 350 F (177 C).
- In a large bowl with a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the eggs, whole milk, heavy cream, salt, and pepper together on high speed until completely combined, about 1 minute. Whisk in add-ins.
- Bake the quiche until the center is just about set, about 45-55 minutes. Don't over-bake. Use a pie crust shield to prevent the pie crust edges from over-browning. Allow to cool for 15 minutes. Top with optional toppings before slicing and serving, if desired. Or you can cool the quiche completely before serving- it's fantastic at room temperature!
- This quiche makes great leftovers! Cover tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
tips:
- Quiche Recipes- Leave out added salt, then whisk in these ingredients in step 4. Crab, Old Bay, & Gruyere- 1 and 1/2 cups fresh jumbo lump crabmeat (it's sold as "fresh" but it is always pre-cooked), 1 cup shredded gruyere cheese, 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning, and dash of hot sauce. Bacon, White Cheddar, & Scallion- 6-8 cooked and crumbled bacon slices, 1 cup white cheddar cheese, and 3 Tablespoons chopped scallion. Ham, Spinach, & Feta- 1 cup cooked and cubed ham, 3 cups chopped fresh spinach (saute for a few minutes with a drizzle of olive oil over medium heat), and 3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese.
- Whole Milk & Heavy Cream- Use this combination for best taste. If desired, use 1 cup of half-and-half instead.
- Cheese- Some favorites include feta cheese, goat cheese, white cheddar cheese, Swiss cheese, and gruyere.
- Add-Ins- Add up to 2 cups add-ins including vegetables and meat/seafood. Most quiche add-ins should be pre-cooked and can still be warm when mixing into the egg filling. Pat dry prior to mixing in. See blog post for more information.
- Added Salt- Reduce or leave out salt if your add-ins and cheese are particularly salty. For example, in the 3 recipes listed in the next note, I don't even add salt!
- Make Ahead & Freezing instructions- The pie dough can be prepared ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months. You can pre-bake the crust ahead of time too. See end of step 2. To freeze, cool baked quiche completely, then cover tightly with a couple sheets of aluminum foil and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator or on the counter, then bake at 350 F (177 C) for 20-25 minutes.

- Corn tortillas (12 ish tortillas)
- Bag of frozen veggies (1 ish lbs- carrots, peas, green beans, etc)
- Cream of Mushroom (1 can)
- Golden Mushroom (1 can)
- Cheese (enough for 3 layers- either cheddar or monterey jack or mix)
instructions:
- I don't have a recipe written down but this one (link below) is pretty close to what I do.  The primary difference is instead of bell peppers I use a bag of frozen veggies. 
- I boil chicken (slow and low so it's tender). Then I shred the chicken (after it cools a bit) and set aside (carrots, peas, etc.).
- I mix the frozen veggies in a large bowl with some of the hot/warm broth and add a can of Cream of Mushroom and a can of Golden Mushroom.
- Slice the corn tortillas into strips. 
- Then layer a greased casserole pan with veggie mixture, shredded chicken, tortilla strips and cheese. Repeat until the ingredients run out. 
- Bake in the oven (preheated to 375) for 40 minutes.  I also broil it for a minute or two until the top layer of cheese starts to bubble and slightly brown.
- CAREFUL with the broiler.  You CAN NOT leave it alone.  Constantly watch the broiler. It goes from starting to brown to full on burn in what seems like an instant.

ingredients:
- 1 lb ground turkey or beef
- 1 packet taco seasoning low sodium
- (prepare meat using instructions in the packet and set aside)
- 1 bag minute brown or white rice cooked (follow instructions in packet)
- 1 can pinto beans (drained and rinsed)
- 1 can enchilada sauce el Paso (biggest can)
- 1 can unsalted corn (drained)
- 1 big bag of Mexican shredded cheese (the more cups the cheesier)
- 2 medium bags Fritos (you can substitute with mission corn tortillas)
- 1 tub sour cream for toping
- 1 avocado for toping
instructions:
-  Preheat oven to 350 F 
-  In a Pyrex pan put a thin layer of enchilada sauce and proceed to place all the ingredients in layers evenly distributed. 
-  I will do the crushed chips or tortillas first, then the meat, corn, a layer of cheese (a rich layer is better), rice, beans and more tortillas or chips crushed. 
-  Top the whole thing with a lot of cheese and the sauce. The sauce is at the end and make sure it sips through the bottom by poking the whole thing with a fork several times and all over. 
-  Wiggle the fork to promote liquid movement to the bottom of the pan.  
-  Place in oven and cook for 35 minutes.
tips:
- To make it more healthy you can make your own taco seasoning (1 tbsp chili powder, 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt,  1 1/2 tsp cumin, 1 1/2 tsp cornstarch, 1 tsp pepper), use 1 cup of regular brown rice, organic meat and beans, and tortillas.  You can also make your own enchilada sauce just look for a healthy recipe on the internet.

preptime: 30

cooktime: 30
servings: 1

ingredients:
- 2 lbs (908 g) boneless skinless chicken thighs
- 11/2 tbsp (23 g) olive oil
- 1 medium (150 g) red bell pepper
- 1 medium (150 g) green bell pepper
- 1 medium (200 g) onion
- 31/2 cups (525 g) cooked rice
- 1 tbsp (15 g) lime juice
- 4 tbsp (60 g) chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
- 1 tsp (3 g) garlic powder
- salt and pepper to taste
instructions:
- For the Rice
- Cook enough rice to yield 31/2 cups of cooked rice. 1 cup of dry rice will yield between 2-3 cups of cooked rice.
- For the Chicken
- I prefer to cook this in the air fryer. If you don't have one you can use the bake and broil method in the oven. Preheat your air fryer to 400 F or your oven to 425 F.
- Cut the chipotle peppers into a mince with some of the adobo sauce until you have about 1/4 cup worth.
- Season the chicken with salt and pepper and add about 2 tbsp of the chipotle peppers and adobo sauce. Toss the chicken to coat with the sauce.
- Place the chicken into your air fryer basket and air fry for 8-12 minutes, flipping halfway.
- If you bake it, place it on a sheet pan in the oven on the top rack for 10 minutes, then turn the oven to broil and broil for about 3 minutes each side or until it has developed color. The thickness of your chicken will impact cooking time. If it needs more or less time, pull it out when it is done.
- For the Peppers and Onion
- Wash and cut your peppers into a large dice. Cut the onion into slices.
- In a large skillet, heat some oil over medium high heat. Add the onions and cook for 4-5 minutes until they have begun to caramelize.
- Add more oil if needed and add in the peppers. Season with salt to help bring out some of the moisture. Cook for 3-4 minutes and remove from the pan.
- For the Finished Dish
- Cut the chicken into a medium dice.
- Into a large skillet, add the chicken and allow it to develop a bit more color on all sides. Add in the peppers and onions, 31/2 cups of cooked rice and the remaining chipotle peppers. Toss to coat evenly.
- Add the garlic powder and lime juice. Stir to incorporate and season with salt and pepper to taste.
