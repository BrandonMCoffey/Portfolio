Hello! I'm Brandon, a freelance programmer and technical artist who specializes in AR/VR, game development, 3D graphics, and interactive media.

<br>

In 2023 I graduated from the University of Texas at Dallas in the [ATEC program](https://aht.utdallas.edu/degrees/undergraduate-degrees/arts-technology-and-emerging-communication/) with a focus in Animation and Games. During my time at UTD, I was constantly being introduced to different software packages, artistic techniques, design practices, coding skills, and more. I loved learning about every type of development, especially those involving experimental or cutting edge technology, which is how I started working at the [MI Lab]({{site.url}}/mi-lab/) and the [VAST Lab]({{site.url}}/vast-lab/) as a VR programmer.

<br>

Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/BrandonMCoffey) for some of my public coding projects and games, and the rest of my [portfolio]({{site.url}}/projects/) for everything I have worked on.
