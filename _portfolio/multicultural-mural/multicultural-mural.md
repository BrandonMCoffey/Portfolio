The original Multi-cultural Mural was created in 1980 by artists Gilberto Guzman, Zara Kriegstein, and a team of volunteers that included Frederico Vigil, Cassandra Harris, Rosemary Stearns, and David Bradley. Multi-cultural honored the contributions made by different cultures to the history of New Mexico. Painted on the east wall of the State Records Center and Archives, the mural measured 110 x 18 feet and was repainted in 1993 by Guzman to repair damage from the elements.

Now, a QR code on a plaque at the same location will allow viewers to visualize the 1993 version of Multi-cultural on the side of the Vladem Contemporary through an augmented reality application on a smart device.
